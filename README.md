# ✈️ Travel Journal

This is a simple **React** project that demonstrates how to use **props** to build reusable and dynamic components.

## 📌 How It Works

The **Travel Journal** displays a list of travel destinations, each rendered using a child component that receives data — such as the **location**, **date**, **description**, and **image** — through props.

This is a great example for beginners to learn how to:

- Pass data between components
- Create reusable UI elements
- Build modular React apps

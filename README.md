✈️ Travel Journal — A Simple React Project
This project is a straightforward React application that demonstrates how to use props to create reusable and dynamic components.

The Travel Journal displays a list of travel destinations, each rendered through a child component that receives data—such as location, date, description, and an image—via props.

This example is ideal for beginners learning how to pass data between components and build modular, maintainable React applications.
